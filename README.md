For those with multi-monitor setups with different resolutions running Windows.

When you move the mouse across the boundary from one screen to another, the mouse position you see in real life appears to jump up or down.  This project aims to make the mouse appear to have a real-life continuous path across the boundary.

The mathematics and precalculation is completely overdone, so the program will support absurd things like hexagonal monitors.  If two monitors share a straight edge boundary, this program can create a mouse portal between them.
